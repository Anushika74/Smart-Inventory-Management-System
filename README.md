Smart Inventory Management System with AI-Based Business Insights

A complete Java Web Application for a supermarket / retail shop that manages products, stock and sales, and adds four AI/ML-powered features for smart business decisions.

    Module: Java Web Application Development — Final Assignment

Features
Part 1 — Core Inventory System

    User Authentication — login / logout with roles (ADMIN / STAFF)
    Product Management — add / update / delete / search products
    Inventory Management — add stock, update quantity, view stock, low-stock alerts
    Sales Management — record sales, generate bills/invoices, sales history
    Reports — daily sales, monthly sales, product stock report

Part 2 — AI / ML Enhancement

    Smart Restock Prediction — predicts days-to-stockout and recommended restock quantity from sales velocity and historical demand (linear regression).
    Fast & Slow Moving Product Analysis — classifies products as Fast / Slow / Dead stock (with charts).
    Sales Trend Analysis — analyses daily / weekly / monthly sales and forecasts the next period.
    Intelligent Alerts — low stock, overstock, sudden sales drops and expiring products.

Architecture


If the Python AI service is not running, the Java app automatically falls back to an equivalent built-in rule-based AI engine, so AI insights always work.
🧰 Tech Stack
Layer 	Technology
Web / Backend 	Java 17, Spring Boot 3.3, Spring MVC, Spring Security

Persistence 	Spring Data JPA, Hibernate, MySQL 8
AI / ML 	Python 3, Flask, scikit-learn, pandas, numpy
Build 	Maven
🚀 How to Run (Ubuntu + NetBeans)
1. Prerequisites

    JDK 17 or 21 (java -version)
    Maven (bundled with NetBeans)
    MySQL Server 8 (sudo apt install mysql-server)
    Python 3.10+ (only if you want the ML microservice; optional)

2. Set up MySQL

sudo systemctl start mysql
sudo mysql -u root -p

-- Optional: the app can auto-create the DB, but you can create it manually:
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS smart_inventory;
-- Make sure the credentials match application.properties (default root/root):
ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'root';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

    Edit src/main/resources/application.properties if your MySQL username/password differ.

3. Run the Java web app

In NetBeans: Open the project (it is a Maven project) → Right-click → Run.

Or from the terminal:

cd smart-inventory-system
mvn spring-boot:run

On first run the app auto-seeds 55 products and ~1200 sales records with realistic patterns (weekend spikes, fast/slow/dead stock, expiring products).

Open: http://localhost:8080
4. (Optional) Run the AI microservice

cd ai-service
python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py        # serves on http://localhost:5000

The Java app calls it automatically. If it's off, the rule-based fallback is used.
